## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Uses the microphone to capture spoken input and convert it into text.
- **Text Input**: Users can also type in the text if they prefer not to use speech.
- **Image Generation**: The app uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate images based on the text or speech input.

## Requirements

The application requires the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `PIL`
- `torch`
- `diffusers`
- `speech_recognition`

See the `requirements.txt` file for more details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Niketkumardheeryan/speech-to-image-converter.git
   cd speech-to-image-converter
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run speech-text_image_generator.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Speech Input**: Click the button to start listening for speech input, and the application will convert it to text and generate an image based on the recognized text.
- **Text Input**: Alternatively, you can type in a description to generate an image.
