# Dataset Description

State Variables:
-----------------

- Waste Level: A normalized value between 0 (empty) and 1 (full), indicating how full the waste container is.
- Time of Day: A random value between 0 and 24, representing the time in hours.
- Weather Conditions: A random value between 0 and 1 to represent different weather conditions, which could influence waste generation.
- Distance to Collection Point: A random value between 0 and 10, representing the distance to the waste collection point.

Action Space:
--------------

Action 0: Wait and do not collect waste.
Action 1: Collect the waste.

Reward Mechanism:
------------------

Positive Reward: A reward of +10 is given for collecting waste when the waste level exceeds a certain threshold (timely collection).
Negative Reward: A reward of -1 for every time step that passes to incentivize efficiency and a penalty of -5 for collecting waste when itâ€™s not yet near the threshold.

Simulated Environment Parameters:
-----------------------------------
The waste level increases gradually, with overflow penalties if it exceeds the maximum capacity.
Episodes run for 20 timesteps, with overflow events tracked for evaluation.


Model Performance Tracking:
-----------------------------
You also track the following metrics per episode:

Average Reward: The average reward earned in each episode.
Epsilon Decay: Tracks the exploration rate as it decays over time.
Overflow Events: Number of times waste overflowed in each episode.
